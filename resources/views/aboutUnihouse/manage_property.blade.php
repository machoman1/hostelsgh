                <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18px">How the Property Management service works</span>

                <p>Step 1. A free initial appraisal of your property will be carried out. Visits are usually in early autumn to allow a 'lead in' time prior to the new student letting cycle.</p>

                <p>Step 2. If we think your property is a positive inclusion to our portfolio, we will pay a second visit to carry out a full report.</p>

                <p>The report will offer specific guidance and advice on;</p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;list-style-type: circle;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px">
                    <li>The condition of the property and any work needed</li>
                    <li>Health and safety matters</li>
                    <li>Suggested rent and number of occupants the house is suitable for</li>
                    <li>Recommendations to maximise letting</li>
                    <li>Answers to any queries raised by the owner</li>
                </ul><br> 
                <p>The cost of the report is GHC 160 plus VAT* and is payable before the second visit. If you continue to full management, the cost of this report will be credited against the set up fees as detailed below. </p>

                <p>Step 3. Once all the appropriate paperwork is signed and submitted, we will prepare the marketing material for your property in time for House Hunting. </p>
