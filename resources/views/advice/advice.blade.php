                        <span>In the case of an emergency that requires the emergency services (burglary or vandalism), this must be reported to the police and a crime reference number supplied to Hostelgh.</span>

                        <span>If forced entry was used, call Hostelgh so we can send someone to secure the property for you. This may be a temporary repair like boarding up a window or securing a door.</span>

                        <span>Our tenancy support staff will be in touch with you on the next working day to see if you need further assistance.</span>

                        <span>In the case of serious fire, call 999 and then once you are safe, call Hostelgh to report what has happened.  </span>

                        <span style="padding-top:10px;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">Flood</span> 
                        <span>A serious flood is where the water will not stop. If you can, find the stop tap to turn of the supply and limit the damage to the property. Quite often stop taps are located in kitchen cupboards near the sink. Call Hostelgh to report it. </span>

                        <span>A leak from a bath, shower, sink or washing machine will normally stop after a while, once the contents have dispersed. This is not an emergency and you should take steps to dry the area out. Do not use this area again until it is fixed, so remember to report it to Hostelgh using the normal channels. The electrics may not work for a while until they have dried out, but the modern RCD system is in place to keep you safe and once dry, you should be able to turn the effected area on again </span>

                        <span>Call Hostelgh and take the following action;</span>

                            <li>Open doors and windows</li>

                            <li>Avoid using any naked flames or electrical switches</li>
                        </ul>
                        <span>The National Gas Emergency Service (National Grid) can be called to attend on 0800 111 999 and they will come and turn the gas off. They aim to attend within two hours. Their engineers will always 'make safe' when called to a suspected gas leak. It could be from the meter itself or an appliance in the property.</span>

                        <span>The emergency service provided by them doesnâ€™t cover repairs to appliances (cooker/boiler installation or pipework, so you still need to report the incident to Hostelgh so we can deploy a Gas Safe registered engineer.</span>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold">How to report a repair accurately</span><br><br>
                            <span>Whichever method you choose to contact us, always describe the damage or problem as fully as you can to help us make the repair as effectively as possible. If you report the problem in detail, the necessary repair can be done much more quickly</span><br><br>
                            <span>Please describe the location of a problem according to this scheme: Cellar/basement; ground floor; first floor; second floor; attic floor. Always describe the location as if you are standing in the street outside the front of the property. For example, first floor front left bedroom.</span><br><br>
                            <span>If you report a problem inaccurately or inadequately, or if a repair is unnecessary, then you may be charged a call-out fee.</span><br><br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Access to the property for repairs</span><br><br>
                            <span>When reporting a problem that needs repair, you will be asked for your consent for a contractor to enter your property to do the necessary work. (They will collect a key from our office). Alternatively, you can ask for someone to call you to arrange a mutually convenient time.</span><br><br>
                            <span>Remember, most contractors have to undertake repairs between 8am and 5pm, Monday to Friday - they cannot turn out in the evenings for anything other than emergencies.</span><br><br>
                            <span>If the contractor calls at the agreed date and time and you are not in, then you will be billed for the call-out, which is normally a charge of Â£30 - Â£40.</span><br><br>
                            <span>At certain times of the year contractors may call to carry out servicing and safety checks on appliances. It is not always possible to let you know exactly when they will be making their visit, but you will be informed when the servicing will start.</span><br><br>

                            <span>It is important that if the rent is due and you are not able to pay that you contact the finance office to either arrange a short delay in the payment due date or agree a payment plan to help you complete your payments. If you have difficulty paying because of a cash flow problem and you need extra time, or you wish to discuss any special arrangements because of financial problems, please contact the Finance staff who will do their very best to help you.</span><br>
                            <span>UniHouse try to be flexible and helpful. It is not, however, UniHouse intention to become a bank and â€˜lendâ€™ money to students so we often advise students to seek assistance from the banks if you are having problems in meeting your obligations.</span><br>
                            <span style="padding-top:10px;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">What happens if you miss payment dates?</span><br>
                            <span>If you miss a payment and have not been in touch about it, Hostelgh will take the following steps:</span>
                            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;list-style-type: circle;font-size:16px">
                                <li>Step One - the first letter will be sent out 7 days after the due date</li>
                                <li>This will normally be accompanied by a text message and/or an e-mail. The letter will give 10 days to respond.</li>
                                <li>Step Two - after 5 days a further text message and e-mail will be send and we will try to phone you drawing your attention to the debt and the lack of payment. You will be given a further three working days to respond. (If you are a joint tenant, your co tenants will be told of your debt and the possibility of them having to cover this amount if you do not).</li>
                                <li>Step Three - after 3 days a second letter will be sent, including to your home address, together with a text message and e-mail making clear that payment needed to be immediate otherwise, after 7 days, the matter will be referred to solicitors without further notification. </li>
                                <li>Step Four - after seven days a solicitor's letter will be issued giving a further 7 days for payment. The cost of referring the matter to the solicitor will be passed onto you.</li>
                                <li>Step Five - after that seven days, unless a significant payment is made then Court Action will be initiated to collect the debt and repossession papers will be served, which would enable an eviction to take place. It is possible that a debt collection agency may be involved to recover the debt even after eviction. There are some charges that will be added to your account if Hostelgh goes through the above process.</li>
                                <li>Ultimately Hostelgh will obtain a County Court Judgement against you. This can affect your credit rating and cause you difficulties in the future when you want to obtain credit cards, bank loans and mortgages. Hostelgh will pass on any costs involved in doing this. Although the above system may appear harsh it is transparent and necessary. If you have a debt with Hostelgh you will not be able to sign a further tenancy agreement with Hostelgh.</li>

                            <span>Your tenancy agreement is an important document. It will tell you for how long you are renting the property and are liable for the rent. It will also set out the rent payment dates. If you do not pay your rent on time and Hostelgh staff have to chase payment you will have to pay administration charges.</span><br>
                            <span>The consequences of you not paying your rent could be that you will have a County Court judgement against you, but also it will impact on future rent levels that Hostelgh charges. Having said that Hostelgh will assist students who have genuine cash flow problems and if you contact us as soon as you know you cannot make a rent payment date we will be happy to discuss the matter with you.</span><br>
                            <span>Below is the rent collection and arrears management procedure that Unihouse operates. Many landlords follow similar procedures, some are very much tougher than Hostelgh</span><br>
                            <span style="padding-top:10px;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">Rent Payments</span><br><br>
                            <span>Your tenancy agreement states the amount of rent and the dates that you must pay your rent. Always check your bank account to ensure a rent payment has been made correctly. Hostelgh is not able to talk to your bank about your payments and account.</span><br>
                            <span style="padding-top:10px;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">Rent payment for the whole year</span><br><br>
                            <span>Unihouse offer a discount on the total amount of rent payable if you pay all your rent in one payment by a specific date at the beginning of your tenancy. Further details are available at the time of signing your tenancy agreement.</span><br>
                            <span style="padding-top:10px;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">If you pay by debit card or credit card via Worldpay ( through Hostelghâ€™s website or email link payment plan)</span><br><br>
                            <span>Please ensure that you have set up the payment correctly and that you have sufficient funds available on the dates the payments are due. If a payment needs cancelling for any reason then you need to instruct Worldpay not to make the payment before the payment date and inform Hostelgh of how you intend to pay your rent,</span><br>
                            <span>If you are aware that your bank has not made a payment then you need to check with your bank and find out why. You then need to contact the finance team at Hostelgh to arrange payment by an alternative method. If a payment is made in error to Hostelgh, due to banking time delays, a refund will take 7 to 10 working days to process a refund.</span><br>
                            <span>Please note a Worldpay agreement is linked to your debit/credit card and not your bank account. If you need to replace your card you will have to enter your new details. Make sure you keep a record of your payment plan, username and password for future access. This will have been sent to you by Worldpay in an email.</span><br>
                            <span style="padding-top:10px;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">If you pay by Direct Debit</span><br><br>
                            <span>Please check with your bank that they have set up your Direct Debit correctly and that you have the money in your bank account to make the payments on the due dates.</span><br>
                            <span>Unihouse have pre-printed forms that you can complete and return to us. If there is not enough money in your account on the payment day, then your bank may decide not to forward the payment to Hostelgh. If this happens you will have to ask your bank to process the payment again or pay the amount due by an alternative method to Hostelgh. If a Direct Debit needs cancelling for any reason then you need to contact Hostelgh and instruct us to cancel it before the payment date. This needs to be done 10 days before the due date because of banking procedures.</span><br>

                        <span style="padding-top:20px">Contract lengths vary: they are normally 43 weeks for first-year students (starting in mid-September) but most of the houses taken by returning students are let on 52 week contracts - in some instances concessionary rents over the summer are offered.</span><br><br>

                        <span style="padding-top:20px">To keep rents low it is important to keep occupancy high (the fewer empty rooms, the lower the rents need to be for those remaining). So unless exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated, Hostelgh expects all tenants to discharge their contractual obligations and the tenancy cannot be 'cancelled' or a notice period provided.</span><br><br>

                                <span style="padding-left:50px"><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    <li >Step One - the first letter will be sent out 7 days after the due date</li>
                                    <li>This will normally be accompanied by a text message and/or an e-mail. The letter will give 10 days to respond.</li>
                                    <li>Step Two - after 5 days a further text message and e-mail will be send and we will try to 
                                        phone you drawing your attention to the debt and the lack of payment. You will be given a 
                                        further three working days to respond. (If you are a joint tenant, your co tenants will be 
                                        told of your debt and the possibility of them having to cover this amount if you do not).</li>
                                    <li>Step Three - after 3 days a second letter will be sent, including to your home address, 
                                        together with a text message and e-mail making clear that payment needed to be immediate 
                                        otherwise, after 7 days, the matter will be referred to solicitors without further 
                                        notification.</li>
                                    <li>Step Four - after seven days a solicitor's letter will be issued giving a further 7 days for 
                                        payment. The cost of referring the matter to the solicitor will be passed onto you.</li>
                                    <li>Step Five - after that seven days, unless a significant payment is made then Court Action will 
                                        be initiated to collect the debt and repossession papers will be served, which would enable an 
                                        eviction to take place. It is possible that a debt collection agency may be involved to recover 
                                        the debt even after eviction. There are some charges that will be added to your account if 
                                        Hostelgh goes through the above process.</li>
                                    <li>Ultimately Hostelgh will obtain a County Court Judgement against you. This can affect your 
                                        credit rating and cause you difficulties in the future when you want to obtain credit cards, 
                                        bank loans and mortgages. Hostelgh will pass on any costs involved in doing this. Although the 
                                        above system may appear harsh it is transparent and necessary. If you have a debt with Hostelgh 
                                        you will not be able to sign a further tenancy agreement with Hostelgh.</li>

                                <span>Your tenancy agreement is an important document. It will tell you for how long you are renting 
                                    the property and are liable for the rent. It will also set out the rent payment dates. If you do 
                                    not pay your rent on time and Hostelgh staff have to chase payment you will have to pay 
                                    administration charges.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>The consequences of you not paying your rent could be that you will have a County Court 
                                    judgement against you, but also it will impact on future rent levels that Hostelgh charges. 
                                    Having said that Hostelgh will assist students who have genuine cash flow problems and if you 
                                    contact us as soon as you know you cannot make a rent payment date we will be happy to discuss 
                                    the matter with you.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>Below is the rent collection and arrears management procedure that Hostelgh operates. Many 
                                    landlords follow similar procedures, some are very much tougher than Hostelgh</span>

                                <span>Your tenancy agreement states the amount of rent and the dates that you must pay your rent. 
                                    Always check your bank account to ensure a rent payment has been made correctly. Hostelgh is not 
                                    able to talk to your bank about your payments and account.</span>

                                    the time of signing your tenancy agreement.</span>

                                        available on the dates the payments are due. If a payment needs cancelling for any reason then 
                                        you need to instruct Worldpay not to make the payment before the payment date and inform Hostelgh

                                <span>If you are aware that your bank has not made a payment then you need to check with your bank 
                                    and find out why. You then need to contact the finance team at Hostelgh to arrange payment by an 
                                    alternative method. If a payment is made in error to Hostelgh, due to banking time delays, a refund 
                                    will take 7 to 10 working days to process a refund.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>Please note a Worldpay agreement is linked to your debit/credit card and not your bank account. 
                                    If you need to replace your card you will have to enter your new details. Make sure you keep a 
                                    record of your payment plan, username and password for future access. This will have been sent 
                                    to you by Worldpay in an email.</span>

                                <span>Please check with your bank that they have set up your Direct Debit correctly and that you 
                                    have the money in your bank account to make the payments on the due dates.</span>

                                <span>Hostelgh have pre-printed forms that you can complete and return to us. If there is not enough 
                                    money in your account on the payment day, then your bank may decide not to forward the payment 
                                    to Hostelgh. If this happens you will have to ask your bank to process the payment again or pay the 
                                    amount due by an alternative method to Hostelgh. If a Direct Debit needs cancelling for any reason 
                                    then you need to contact Hostelgh and instruct us to cancel it before the payment date. This needs 
                                    to be done 10 days before the due date because of banking procedures.</span>

                         <br><br>
                         <span>Rate Your Landlord is an opinion and ratings website that allows student tenants to leave feedback 
                            about their renting experiences. The site is a joint venture between Hostelgh Student Homes and UCC 
                            University Union (LUU), and is supported by all institutions and colleges in UCC. The site is available 
                            to be used by all students.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">Analysis</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>We have written a summary and analysis of the live reviews on the Rate Your Landlord website</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>The scores paint a positive picture for tenants and for landlords, with the majority of respondents 
                            reporting above average levels of satisfaction with key aspects of their accommodation.  It also gives 
                            clear indications of <span style="font-weight:bold">areas for improvement</span>, particularly around the areas of <span style="font-weight:bold">repairs and customer service</span>. 
                            Both are rooted in the management of expectations and improving communication.  Where we can all get things 
                            wrong from time to time or misjudge how long it will take to get a particularly difficult repair resolved, 
                            how we communicate with our tenants is of the utmost importance.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Rate Your Landlord can be used to your advantage and getting good reviews should lead to getting more 
                            tenants when they house hunt. See below for how to make Rate Your Landlord work for you.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">Capitalise on your good relationships</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>If you have good relationships with your tenants, ask them to review you. If you think theyâ€™ll 
                            score you highly then capitalise on this. Many landlords who have high ratings do so because they 
                            encourage their tenants to review them, and we advise all landlords to do this. This is the surest 
                            way of improving your own scores.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">Your right of reply - how to look good</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>When a tenant reviews you and decides to leave a comment (which is only about half of reviewers, 
                            they are not seeking to have a conversation or discussion with you. In fact, they are unlikely to even 
                            see your reply. It is now over to you to thank them for their feedback, provide some context for an 
                            issue or shed light on a disagreement.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">The most important thing to bear in mind is that future tenants will read your reply, and may consider 
                            their house hunting decision on how you come across.</span><span> The best landlord replies are not only short and 
                            sweet, but positive and thankful, presenting the landlord as someone with a fair temperament from whom a 
                            student would wish to rent a property.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>As a landlord you have a right of reply to any review that is written about you. Once a review is 
                            moderated, Rate Your Landlord will give you five working days to respond. You will be notified via 
                            email with a unique URL link which can be used only once. Your reply is limited to 140 characters, 
                            in line with reviews. Like reviews, all replies will be moderated.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Using your right of reply is important. If you have received a good review then post an acknowledgement 
                            to thank the reviewer. If you have received a bad review, try to state clearly a considered and calm 
                            response. This will often indicate to someone looking later that you respond to criticism well and may 
                            have a very good reason for the situation. Remember, sometimes it isn't always possible to keep everyone 
                            happy but managing expectations, and urging your tenants to review you where you are confident of a good 
                            and accurate review, is likely to balance out any negative ones.</span>

                            <li>from landlords or tenants wishing to rent residential properties in the private rented sector; or</li>

                        <span>A: If landlords should have joined a scheme, but have not, the Local Authority can take action and can 
                            impose a penalty of up to Â£5,000. The Local Authority impose and collect these penalties, and in UCC 183 
                            investigations have taken place and Â£47,500 of invoices have been issued, as of January 2016. A 
                            dissatisfied tenant can also still sue for compensation if they cannot claim through a redress scheme.</span>

                        <span style="opacity:0.7">Q: What Schemes are there?</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>A: There are three schemes that are recognised and landlords must use one of these authorised schemes. These are:</span>
                        <ul style="padding-left: 50px;list-style-type: circle;font-size:16px">
                            <li><a href="#">The Property Ombudsman</a></li>

                        </ul><br><br>
                        <span style="opacity:0.7">Q: Which Scheme Should a Landlord Join â€“ and What is Necessary?</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>A: Look at the individual schemes to see whether you are eligible and how much it costs to join. 
                            When landlords join a scheme they will need to comply with the schemeâ€™s rules. These are based on 
                            existing law, accepted good practice, and principles of fair dealing.  Some landlords may need to 
                            change the way you do some things to make sure they are compliant.  A tenant could complain to the 
                            scheme if landlords do not comply with the rules.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="opacity:0.7">Q: What if a Tenant Complains?</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>A: The scheme will carry out an independent investigation.  The exact procedure will depend on the scheme rules.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>If a complaint is upheld, the scheme can impose sanctions according to the seriousness of the complaint.
                            The scheme might just ask for an apology for something minor â€“ but for something serious landlords can be

                            <span>The deposit scheme is to protect deposits, in order to comply with the law. The scheme also offers
                                 adjudication as means of resolving deposit disputes as an alternative to going to court. Below are 
                                 valid points for Landlords to consider at the beginning and end of a tenancy.</span>
                        <br><br>
                         <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Landlord Obligations</span>
                         <br><br>
                         <span>At the start you must protect the deposit within 30 days of receipt. At the end of the tenancy Landlords must return the deposit/ give a proposal of deductions within ten days of the end of the tenancy.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Holding Deposits</span>
                         <br><br>
                        <span>Some owners take a holding deposit (money to â€˜holdâ€™ a property before an agreement is signed).</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Holding deposit can either be returned or converted into deposit once tenancy starts.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>The deposit needs to be protected once the contract is signed</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Checking out</span>

                        <span>It is important to try and have your tenants present at check out. The tenant may volunteer maintenance 
                            issues such as items put in the right place or curtains rehung. If the tenant is not present, ensure the 
                            report is sent as soon as possible. Once you have itemised what you intend to claim, you should return the 
                            balance within ten days.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Ideal point to: Obtain a forwarding address, check whether the heating is on or off, confirm who the utility suppliers are and get a signature on the check out report. </span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span>What goes in to a check out?</span>

                        <br><br>
                        <span style="opacity:0.7">As a principle, landlords cannot expect to claim more than the cost of putting right an item. If a tenancy is longer or there are more tenants in the property, it will be expected that the proportion of 'wear and tear' is higher. </span>
